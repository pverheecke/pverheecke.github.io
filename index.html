<p>I'm a recent Computer Science graduate of Northwestern University, where I focused on Artificial Intelligence and User Interfaces. My passion, however, lies in discovering the multidisciplinary intersections between Computer Science and traditionally non-technical fields such as music and sports. The potential for software to impact and revolutionize every facet of our culture fascinates me, and I am eager to be a part of shaping the future of computing.</p>
<p>Please feel free to peruse my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and my <a href="/projects">portfolio</a>. I am currently seeking employment, so feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> with any opportunities you might have.</p>
<p>Over in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, I will be writing about my progression through a few personal projects and the methodology behind them, as well as my thoughts on modern tech. I'm new to blogging, so go easy on me!</p>
