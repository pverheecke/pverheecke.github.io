<p>I'm a recent Computer Science graduate of Northwestern University, where I focused on Artificial Intelligence and User Interfaces. My passion, however, lies in exploring the intersection between Computer Science and traditionally non-technical fields such as music, sports, and journalism. The potential for software to impact and revolutionize every facet of our culture fascinates me, and I am eager to be a part of shaping the future of computing.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know a little more about the work I've done, feel free to look through my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and <a href="/projects">portfolio</a>. I am currently seeking full-time employment, so please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> with any opportunities you might have.</p>
<p>Over in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, I'll be writing about my progression through a few personal projects and the methodology behind them, as well as my thoughts on modern tech. I'm new to blogging, so go easy on me!</p>
